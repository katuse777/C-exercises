/*Write a function windChill that takes the values of t and v and returns the
  wind chill. In doing so, your function should take account of two special cases:
  • If there is no wind, windChill should return the original temperature t.
  • If the temperature is greater than 40° F, the wind chill is undefined, and
  your function should call error with an appropriate message.

  35.74 + 0.6215 t – 35.75 v^0.16 + 0.4275 t v^0.16
  where t is the Fahrenheit temperature and v is the wind speed in miles per hour
