/*Without using the built-in string method substr, implement a free function
  substr(str, pos, n) that returns the substring of str beginning at position
  pos and containing at most n characters. Make sure that your function
  correctly applies the following rules:
  • If n is missing or greater than the length of the string, the substring should
  extend through the end of the original string.
  • If pos is greater than the length of the string, substr should call error
  with an appropriate message.
