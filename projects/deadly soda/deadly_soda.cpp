/*A government research lab has concluded that an artificial sweetener commonly
  used in diet soda pop will cause death in laboratory mice. A friend
  of yours is desperate to lose mass but cannot give up soda pop. Your
  friend wants to know how much diet soda pop it is possible to drink without
  dying as a result. Write a program to supply the answer. The input to
  the program is the amount of artificial sweetener needed to kill a mouse
  (use 5 grams), the mass of the mouse (use 35 grams), and the mass of
  the dieter (use 45400 grams for a 100 pound person). Assume that the
  lethal dose for a mouse is proportional to the lethal dose for the human.
  A single can of soda pop has a mass of 350 grams. To ensure the safety of
  your friend, be sure the program requests the mass at which the dieter
  will stop dieting, rather than the dieterâ€™s current mass.
  Assume that diet soda contains 1/10th of 1% artificial sweetener.
  Use a variable declaration
  with the modifier const to give a name to this fraction. You may want to
  express the percent as the double value 0.001. Your program should allow
  the calculation to be repeated as often as the user wishes.

  -------------------------------------------------------
  this function takes the return value of of the how_many_grams_to_kill() function and uses it to determinethe number of cans needed to kill
  a person depending on their target weight, to determine the number of cans needed, we know that there is 0.001 grams of sweetner in a can
  of diet soda and that each can of diet soda has a mass of 350 grams

  the answer is going to be a number with a fractional part but because I'm storing the that number in a integer, the number will be rounded 
  down, giving us the highest number of cans the person can drink without dying
