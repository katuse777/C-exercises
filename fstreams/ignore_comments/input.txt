/*Write a function
  void removeComments(istream & is, ostream & os);
  that copies characters from the input stream is to the output stream os, except
  for characters that appear inside C++ comments. Your implementation should
  recognize both comment conventions:
  • Any text beginning with / * and ending with * /, possibly many lines later.
  • Any text beginning with //and extending through the end of the line
