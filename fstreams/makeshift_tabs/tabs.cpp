/*Some files use tab characters to align data into columns. Doing so, however,
  can cause problems for applications that are unable to work directly with tabs.
  For these applications, it is useful to have access to a program that replaces
  tabs in an input file with the number of spaces required to reach the next tab
  stop. In programming, tab stops are usually set at every eight columns. For
  example, suppose that the input file contains a line of the form
  abc-----|pqrst---|xyz
  where the symbol -----| represents the space taken up by a tab, which differs
  depending on its position in the line. If the tab stops are set every eight
  spaces, the first tab character must be replaced by five spaces and the second
  tab character by three.
  Write a program that copies an input file to an output file, replacing all tab
  characters by the appropriate number of spaces
