/*The filelib.h interface exports several functions that make it easy to work
  with filenames. Two functions that are particularly useful are getRoot and
  getExtension, which divide a function into its root, which is the identifying
  part of the filename, and the extension, which indicates its type. For example,
  given the filename Middlemarch.txt used in the preceding exercise, the
  root is Middlemarch and the extension is .txt (note that filelib.h defines
  the extension to includes the dot). Write the code necessary to implement
  these functions. To find out how to handle special cases, such as filenames
  that donâ€™t include a dot, consult the filelib.h interface in Appendix A.
