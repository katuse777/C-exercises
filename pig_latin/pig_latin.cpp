/*In Pig Latin, words are formed from their English counterparts by applying the following rules:
  1. If the word contains no vowels, no translation is done, which means that the
  translated word is the same as the original.
  2. If the word begins with a vowel, the function adds the string "way" to the end
  of the original word.
  3. If the word begins with a consonant, the function extracts the string of
  consonants up to the first vowel, moves that collection of consonants to the end
  of the word, and adds the string "ay".
