/*In statistics, a collection of data values is often referred to as a distribution.
  One of the primary goals of statistical analysis is to find ways to compress the
  complete set of data into summary statistics that express properties of the
  distribution as a whole. The most common statistical measure is the mean,
  which is simply the traditional average. For the distribution x1, x2, x3, . . . , xn,
  the mean is usually represented by the symbol .
  Write a function
    double mean(Vector<double> & data);
  that returns the mean of the data in the vector
